rfid_write Arduino code utilizes the MFRC522 library to interact with an RFID reader. Here’s a brief breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Setup**:
   - Initializes serial communication at 9600 baud rate.
   - Initializes the SPI bus and the MFRC522 RFID reader.

2. **Loop**:
   - Continuously checks for new RFID cards.
   - If a card is detected, it reads its UID (Unique Identifier) and prints it to the serial monitor.
   - It demonstrates updating the tag's data by writing a new value (`"123456"`) to the card's memory.
   - After writing, it confirms whether the update was successful or if there was an error.
   - It halts the card communication and stops encryption before repeating the loop after a delay of 1 second. 

This code essentially reads the UID of an RFID card and attempts to write a new value to it whenever a card is detected.
